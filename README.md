# Boris Bike

This project wants to build a program that will emulate a series of docking stations and bikes for public use. 

Each day I have been pairing with a different person. The result of each pairing session has been push on a separate branch.


Focus
1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. OO principles (Ruby)
